## The Project
This project is a final release of a Master work that I did in 2015, UAB/Barcelona - Spain. The idea is to control symbols as dots, lines and polygons through the map scaa.


## The Solution
Control dots, lines and polygon using different kinds of colors and representations throught the map scale.

## Technology
This project was mad in JS using `jQuery` and `jQueryUI`. The dat was saved in `Geoserver` and manipulated using `postGIS` from `postgresSQL`

## How to install
-----------------

## Note
Due to the lack of time and technology it is possible that something may not work well.
